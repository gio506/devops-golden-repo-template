# Contributing Guide

Thanks for contributing! This template is designed to stay simple, consistent, and easy for beginners.

## 1) Before you start

- Read `README.md` for repository purpose.
- Read `docs/standards.md` for branch and commit rules.
- Open an issue for major changes before implementation.

## 2) Branch strategy

- Create feature branches from `main`.
- Use branch names like:
  - `feat/<short-description>`
  - `fix/<short-description>`
  - `docs/<short-description>`
  - `chore/<short-description>`

## 3) Commit style

Use Conventional Commits:

- `feat: add reusable workflow template`
- `fix: correct shellcheck stage condition`
- `docs: improve standards examples`

## 4) Pull request checklist

- [ ] CI passes.
- [ ] Changes are documented (README/docs if needed).
- [ ] Security impact is considered.
- [ ] PR description includes what changed and why.

## 5) Code review expectations

- Keep PRs focused and small where possible.
